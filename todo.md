- [ ] Reverse gear handling
  - [ ] Should not be treated as a "zero" gear
  - [ ] Maybe using reverse gear should not be possible? Or should decrease RPM fast? Or should break the car?
- [ ] Every turn should have recommended speed
- [ ] There should be multiple opponents, every one would be just a small circle with number
- [ ] There is something wrong with my acceleration calculations â€“ new supercar has worse acceleration than basic sport car
